				<h2>My Mission</h2>
				<p>Tech Time with Jacob is a nonprofit initiative aimed at empowering residents in 55 and over communities throughout South Florida with the knowledge and support they need to tackle technology-related challenges.</p>
				<p>As we know, technology plays a significant role in enhancing the quality of life for seniors. However, the learning curve can sometimes be steep. Through my initiative, I provide personalized assistance for software issues on phones, tablets, and laptops. This includes troubleshooting, application setup, internet and email support, and guidance on security best practices.</p>

						<p>Hi there, my name is Jacob! I'm a high school student from South Florida, currently in my senior year at American Heritage School in Boca Delray. My journey with computers started at a very young age, and since then, my curiosity and passion for technology have only grown.</p>
						<p>I am deeply invested in computer science and plan to major in it during my college years. My ultimate goal is to become a software engineer. Through my education and personal projects, I have developed a skill set that I am eager to share with others, especially those who might find the ever-evolving world of technology a bit daunting.</p>
						<p>Running Tech Time with Jacob is not just a project for me, but a way to give back to my community. By helping the residents in 55 and over communities, I aim to make a difference by sharing the knowledge that has been a significant part of my life.</p>
